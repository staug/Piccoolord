Action point:
In my roguelike game Tyrant I used a system of action points and speed ratings.
Basically:

Most actions had a AP cost of 100
Most creatures have a speed of 100
Then the game loop would go as follows.

Hero takes an action.
Elapsed time is calculated as hero action AP cost * 100 / hero speed
All creatures get given APs equal to creature speed * elapsed time / 100
Creatures take actions and have APs subtracted until their APs are <= 0
Repeat
This system worked very nicely overall, example nice features:

If you have a very fast hero (perhaps due to a magic speed bonus), you can get several moves in before an individual creature can move (it's APs would be negative for a few turns because the elapsed time would be small)
You can make some actions more or less expensive by varying the AP cost
You can delay creatures by subtracting APs, or give them a sudden one-off boost by adding APs
